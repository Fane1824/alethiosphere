# Introduction

This is the course project for the course "Design & Analysis of Software Systems" (DASS). It is a group project consisting of 5 people under the direction of our client, Jazeel Jabbar. 

The project uses an agile methodology to ensure that the code is well documented. 

The original repository is currently under the DASS organization, which makes it inaccessible to the public. This is an up-to-date version of our progress.
